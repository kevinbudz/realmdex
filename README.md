# realmdex
> An electron based auto-updater for all RotMG private servers!
## Premise.
Giving private servers as much ease of access as possible. The Realmdex app allows users to see each game's live player count, discord, and download links for flash/AIR. If everything can be conveniently laid out for the user, then they are more likely to play private servers on a whim decision, resulting in more players on overall. If they gotta look for `UT Realms (28).zip`, and debug the AIR executable when it doesn't for work some reason, it's more likely for that process to discourage you from getting on. You get what I'm saying?
